        "# How to write a training loop in Chainer\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook session we will learn how to train a deep neural network to classify hand-written digits using the popular MNIST dataset. This dataset contains 50000 training examples and 10000 test examples. Each example contains a 28x28 greyscale image and a corresponding class label for the digit. Since the digits 0-9 are used, there are 10 class labels. \n",
        " \n",
        "Chainer provides a feature called `Trainer` that can be used to simplify the training process. However, we think it is good for first-time users to understand how the training process works before using the `Trainer` feature. Even advanced users might sometimes want to write their own training loop and so we will explain how to do so here. The complete training process consists of the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Prepare a datasets that contain the train/validation/test examples.\n",
        "2. Optionally set of iterators for the datasets.\n",
        "3. Write a training loop that performs the following operations in each iteration:\n",
        "     1. Retreive batches of examples from the training dataset.\n",
        "     2. Feed the batches into the model.\n",
        "     3. Run the forward pass on the model to compute the loss.\n",
        "     4. Run the backward pass on the model to compute the gradients.\n",
        "     5. Run the optimizer on the model to update the parameters.\n",
        "     6. (Optional): Ocassionally check the performance on a validation/test set.\n"

This means that we also need to provide the attribute name that we want to use for each link that is supplied. We do this by providing the attribute name and corresponding link object as keyword arguments to `__init__`, as we will do in the `MLP` chain below.\n",
        "2. We need to define a `__call__` method that allows our chain to be called like a function. This method takes one or more `Variable` objects as input (that is, the input activations) and returns one or more `Variable` objects. This method executes the forward pass of the model by calling any of the links that we supplied to `__init__` earlier as well as any functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the links only need to be supplied to `__init__`, not `__call__`. This is because they contain parameters. Since functions do not contain any parameters, they can be called in `__call__` without having to supply them to the chain beforehand. For example, we can use a function such as `F.relu` by simply calling it in `__call__` but a link such as `L.Linear` would need to first be supplied to the chain's `__init__` in order to call it in `__call__`.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In Chainer, the Python code that implements the forward computation code itself represents the model. In other words, we can conceptually think of the computation graph for our model being constructed dynamically as this forward computation code executes. This allows Chainer to describe networks in which different computations can be performed in each iteration, such as branched networks, intuitively and with a high degree a flexibiity.

For other types of problems, such as regression models, other loss functions might be more appropriate. See the Chainer documentation for detailed information on the various loss functions that are available.\n",

        "Our training loop will be structured as follows. We will first get a mini-batch of examples from the training dataset. We will then feed the batch into our model by calling our model (a `Chain` object) like a function. This will execute the forward-pass code that we wrote for the chain's `__call__` method that we wrote above. This will cause the model to output class label predictions that we supply to the loss function along with the true (that is, target) values. The loss function will output the loss as a `Variable` object. We then clear any previous gradients and perform the backward pass by calling the `backward` method on the loss variable which computes the parameter gradients. We need to clear the gradients first because the `backward` method accumulates gradients instead of overwriting the previous values. Since the optimizer already was given a reference to the model, it already has access to the parameters and the newly-computed gradients and so we can now call the `update` method of the optimizer which will update the model parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point you might be wondering how calling `backward` on the loss variable could possibly compute the gradients for all of the model parameters. This works as follows. First recall that all activation and parameter arrays in the model are instances of `Variable`. During the forward pass, as each function is called on its inputs, we save references in each output variable that refer to the function that created it and its input variables. In this way, by the time the final loss variable is computed, it actually contains backward references that lead all the way back to the input variables of the model. That is, the loss variable contains a representation of the entire computational graph of the model, which is recomputed each time the forward pass is performed. By following these backward references from the loss variable, each function as a `backward` method that gets called to compute any parameter gradients. Thus, by the time the end of the backward graph is reached (at the input variables of the model), all parameter gradients have been computed.  \n",
